Step 1 => Set Remote Site Settings (https://reqres.in)
step 2 => Create Apex class for callout 
          public class ApexRestCallOutDemo{
              public static void getUsersFromExternalSystem(){
                  HTTP httpObj = new HTTP();  // This creates an instance of the HTTP class, which is used to send the request.
                  HTTPRequest req = new HTTPRequest();   // This creates a new HTTP request.You'll use this object to set the URL (endpoint), method (GET, POST, etc.), headers, and body.

                  req.setEndpoint('https://reqres.in/api/users'); //this is where we need to give external Systems End Point URL 
                  req.setHeader('Content-Type','application/json');  // this will shows like in which laguage we are geting the data JSON/XML 
                  req.setMethod('GET'); // because we are getting the data from external system 
                  req.setBody(''); // here we are not using cause we are not sending the data to external system 

                  HTTPResponse res = new HTTPResponse();
                  res = httpObj.send(req);  // in res object we are getting the response of the object 

                  system.debug(res.getBody()); //directly using res we are not able to get the data we need to use getBody(); method 
              }
          }
step 3 => Call Apex Class and mehod using anonymous window.
