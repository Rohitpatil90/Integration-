# Call External System from salesforce using soap callout 
# Things to do for Soap Callout 
         1) Get WSDL (Web Service Description Language ) File
         2) upload wsdl file in salesforce setup
         3) salesforce generates methods from wsdl file that calls external sysytem
         4) first we have to call authentication method then we have to call actual service method 
         5) the system which is offering services will give you WSDL File before you build your integration 

# In this scenario salesforce calls external system by passing country name and external system gives you famous park names 
  available in that country 
   step 1 => Create Remote site settings (https://th-apex-soap-service.herokuapp.com)
   step 2 => In setUp got to apex classes then select genrate apex class from WSDL file 
   step 3 => call main apex class and inner apex and the method which will return park names from anonymous window 
             parksServices.ParksImplPort parkobj = new parksServices.ParksImplPort();
             List <String> parknames = parkobj.byCountry('Germany');
             system.debug('Park Names =>>' + parknames);
             OUT Put -> Park Names =>>(Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park, Hainich National Park, Bavarian Forest National Park)

  = get wsdl file 
  = upload wsdl file 
  = add endpoint url in remote site settings 
  = call authorize method // this is not applicable for our scenario becuse this is publically available API 
  = call actual method
